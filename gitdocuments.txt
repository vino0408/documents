How do Git and GitHub work together?
When you upload files to GitHub, you'll store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to your files in GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.

There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.

However, most people work on their files locally (on their own computer), then continually sync these local changes—and all the related Git data—with the central "remote" repository on GitHub. There are plenty of tools that you can use to do this, such as GitHub Desktop.

Once you start to collaborate with others and all need to work on the same repository at the same time, you’ll continually:

Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on GitHub.
Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.
Git figures out how to intelligently merge this flow of changes, and GitHub helps you manage the flow through features such as "pull requests."
